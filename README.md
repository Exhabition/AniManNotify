[![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/799392333677854751.svg)](https://top.gg/bot/799392333677854751)

Bot for notifying you about new anime episodes:

Commands:
 - `!addAnime` **MALID**
 - `!deleteAnime` **MALID**
 - `!listAnime`

*MALID is ID from My Anime List

Example:
Anime: **https://myanimelist.net/anime/40028/**
Adding anime: **!addAnime 40028**

We only notify for animes that are currently airing.

We will notify you when episodes airs in Japan, not on sites that streams anime for you.
Bot will not work always, because I don't have stable hosting yet.
